- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ayesha Darekar! I'm currently a statistics and physics double major at NC State University. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring the intersection of programming, data analysis, and statistical methods in physics, space science and exploration. 
- ðŸŒ± I recently completed an internship at SAS on the US Energy Pre-Sales team where I gained experience in machine learning, data analytics, and data visualization. Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Python to analyze spectra variations among multiple sightlines of a gravitationally lensed quasar image. On the side, I am learning about machine learning on Kaggle.
